This revised code snippet addresses the feedback by ensuring that the `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable is set before executing any functionality. It also simplifies the markdown string to focus on fewer elements while still demonstrating the features of the `telegramify_markdown` library. The use of markdown formatting symbols is more aligned with the gold code, and the formatting is consistent.
